    <h2>About the Community Clean Air Spaces Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard provides near-real-time air quality information for the
      Vancouver Coastal Health region. It uses low-cost AQ sensors deployed across
      the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority region to provide hyperlocal data.
    </p>

      <h2 id="aqhi-title">What is the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI+)?</h2>

      <p>
        The <abbr title="Air Quality Health Index">AQHI</abbr> is a scale that helps you understand how the air around you can affect your health.
        It is a tool meant to guide you in making choices to protect yourself, such as spending less time outside or changing your activities when air pollution levels are high. It ranges from 1 to 10+, with 1 being the best air quality. The Province of British Columbia recommends the use of the AQHI+ (AQHI-Plus). This index is very similar to the older AQHI, but is better-suited to environments that have high particulate matter, such as those affected by wildfires.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AQHI+ is especially important for people who are more sensitive to air pollution, offering advice for times when the air poses
        <strong>low</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>high</strong>, or <strong>very high</strong> health risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The data collected by our sensors is used to calculate the outdoor AQHI+

    <h2>How to Read the Dashboard</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Map:</strong> Colour-coded markers show current AQHI. Click a marker to see details for that sensor.</li>
      <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> Select a sensor and pollutant to see data for the past 24 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor List:</strong> Table view of all active sensors showing current pollutant concentrations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sources &amp; Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Sensor data is updated from community monitors maintained by the University of British Columbia, and calibrated using
      algorithms developed by the research team specifically for these deployments.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Low-cost sensors can drift and may be affected by humidity, temperature, and cross-sensitivities. While calibration
      reduces these errors, always follow local guidance, including official air quality statements.

      <h3 id="how-is-the-aqhi-calculated">How is the AQHI calculated?</h3>
      <p>
        In British Columbia, the AQHI is calculated in two different ways, and the higher of the two
        values is reported:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A combined health-risk calculation using three common air pollutants:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) at ground level,</li>
            <li>Fine Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and</li>
            <li>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>).</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Fine Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentration alone.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3 id="what-is-the-scale-for-the-aqhi">What is the scale for the AQHI?</h3>
      <p>
        The AQHI is measured on a scale ranging from 1–10+. Index values are grouped into health-risk
        categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1–3:</strong> Low health risk</li>
        <li><strong>4–6:</strong> Moderate health risk</li>
        <li><strong>7–9:</strong> High health risk</li>
        <li><strong>10+:</strong> Very high health risk</li>
      </ul>
